## Simple Machine Learning Algorithm

This algorithm could be used to build a list of word string combinations for a basic approach at language recognition.

#### Examples:

word -> apple

string combos -> [app, ap, le, ple, ... ]

word -> house

string combos -> [ho, se, ous, ... ]

##### data.txt file

The data.txt file is used to build a pattern of word behaviour. It's very simple, if a string combination is present in a word, it moves up the list.

Pretty basic machine learning ..
